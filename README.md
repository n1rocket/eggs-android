# Android MVP Architecture: Enhanced with Interactors and Repositories: Practice App

This repository is an extension of the [android-mvp-architecture](https://github.com/MindorksOpenSource/android-mvp-architecture). It breaks the DataManager into Interactors and DbHelper into Repositories. These changes makes it fit for very large projects, for smaller projects the above mentioned repository is better.

This repository contains a detailed sample app that implements MVP architecture enhanced with Interactors and DbRepositories for complete decoupling, using Dagger2, GreenDao, RxJava, FastAndroidNetworking, PlaceHolderView and AndroidDebugDatabase

#### The app has following packages:
1. **data**: It contains all the data accessing and manipulating components.
2. **di**: Dependency providing classes using Dagger2.
3. **ui**: View classes along with their corresponding Presenters and Interactors.
4. **service**: Services for the application.
5. **utils**: Utility classes.

#### Classes have been designed in such a way that it could be inherited and maximize the code reuse.
